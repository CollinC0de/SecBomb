Hello ur prob here to disable dumb "securely". lucky for you i have delivered. 

<hr>

step 1. get the bookmarklet [here](https://github.com/zek-c/extension-v111-kill/blob/main/bookmarklet.js)

<hr>

step 2. put it in a bookmark

<hr>

step 3. go to [Securly ðŸ¤“](https://securly.com)

<hr>

step 4. click the bookmark and type "99"

<hr>

This will hard disable securly. It wont disable the extension, but corrupt the cookies. it will remove the blocking string it adds to the source code of websites it blocks. you can disable by going back to securly clicking the bookmark again and type "1".
